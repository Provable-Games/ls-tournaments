# Loot Survivor Tournaments

This repo provides the contracts and client for Loot Survivor Tournaments. The entire stack utilises Dojo, and shows its capabilities as a framework outside of gaming.

## Contracts

Within the contracts folder we provide the components, contracts and tests for tournaments. This has a fixed relationship with the LS contract, but we are also working on the generalised contract for any game within the tournament repo.

## Client

The client is a vite react app that utilises Dojo for its js SDK and indexer infrastructure.
